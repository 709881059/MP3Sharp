# MP3 Decoder written in CSharp
MP3Sharp is a native C# MP3 decoder, useful for people who want to decode MP3s in .NET managed code. It is a port of JavaLayer, an MP3 decoder for Java written by the JavaZoom team, by [Robert Burke](http://www.robburke.net/). All I've done is spend a few afternoons cleaning up the code; Robert deserves credit for his awesome 'half day project'.

MP3Sharp is released under the [LGPL Version 3](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/MP3Sharp/blob/master/license.txt).
