MP3Sharp is a port of JavaLayer, a MP3 decoder written in Java by JavaZoom and released under the LGPL. JavaLayer was initially ported by [Robert Burke](http://www.robburke.net/), in what he modestly describes as a 'half day project'. [tekHedd](http://www.byteheaven.com/) added some significant speed optimizations. I've cleaned up the code and reduced redundancies.
